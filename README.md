How to Print / Export Resume to PDF
===================================

All Systems
-----------
Grab out/resume-latest.pdf or out/resume-latest-pretty.pdf and print that.

Mac OSX - Plaintext
-------------------
 1. Copy resume.md to out/resume.txt.
 2. Open out/resume.txt in TextEdit.
 3. Make the font 3 sizes smaller (everywhere).
 4. Print or save to PDF via the print menu. A 'print preview' is recommended.
    Do not export to PDF- this will mess up the formatting and varies the font
    size in non-consistent ways.
 5. A PDF copy is kept at out/resume-latest.pdf.

Mac OSX - Pretty Plaintext
--------------------------
 1. Copy resume.md to out/resume-pretty.txt.
 2. Open out/resume-pretty.txt in TextEdit.
 3. Change the format to Rich Text.
 4. Change the font to 'Menlo' and the font size to 8.
 5. Bold each section title (underlined by '========').
 6. Remove any extra whitespace at the end of the document (making rich text
    seems to add a newline).
 7. Print or save to PDF via the print menu. A 'print preview' is recommended.
    Do not export to PDF- this will mess up the formatting and varies the font
    size in non-consistent ways.
 8. A PDF copy is kept at out/resume-latest-pretty.pdf.
