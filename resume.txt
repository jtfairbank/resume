I like working in the terminal.  Markdown's efficient.  I'd much rather be
writing code than formatting resumes. daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

Projects and Work Experience
===============================================================================
Election Analytics (Summer - Fall 2012)
---------------------------------------
I am taking an independent study course with Professor Sheldon Jacobson that
tracks and analyzes polling data to forcast the upcoming November 2012
elections.  Specifically, my work includes the creation of the Senate 2012
portion of the site and a web-spider to automate the collecting and processing
of polling data.  I am also working on transitioning our version control from
SVN to GIT, and setting up workflow processes that take advantage of branching
and other modern version control features.
